# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to `allure-testops-mcp`.

## Development Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Run in dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Pre-commit hooks

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for basic file hygiene and to
run ESLint before each commit. Install the hook once after cloning:

```bash
pipx install pre-commit   # or: brew install pre-commit / pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Run against the whole repo manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The ESLint hook needs the project's `node_modules`, so run `npm install` first.
Configuration lives in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

Run smoke test:

```bash
ALLURE_TESTOPS_URL="https://allure-testops.instance.com/" \
ALLURE_TOKEN="your-api-token" \
ALLURE_PROJECT_ID="37" \
npm run test:integration
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and small.
- Include clear PR description: what changed and why.
- Update docs if behavior, API, or setup changed.
- Ensure `npm run build` passes.
- Ensure `npm run lint` passes.
- If touching API behavior, run `npm run test:integration` where possible.
- CI must be green before merge.

## Local Validation Checklist

Run before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

Optional API smoke verification:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## Branch Protection (Maintainers)
